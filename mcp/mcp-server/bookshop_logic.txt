Business Logic: Automatic Stock Replenishment Alert
Scenario:
The bookshop wants to avoid running out of stock for popular books. An automated alert should notify the inventory manager when a book’s stock falls below a threshold.

Business Rules:

If a book’s available stock drops below 5 copies, trigger a "Low Stock Alert" for the inventory team.

Include the book’s title, current stock level, and supplier details in the alert.

For books marked as "Bestsellers", set a higher threshold (e.g., alert if stock < 10 copies).
